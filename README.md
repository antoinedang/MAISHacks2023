# McGill AI Society Hackathon - Music Generation Project

Welcome to our music generation project powered by an RNN from Google Magenta! This project was created during the McGill AI Society Hackathon, where a team of four talented individuals worked tirelessly to bring this musical experience to life in less than 24 hours.

## Introduction

This project combines the power of Google Magenta's Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a user-friendly UI and a robust backend to allow users to control the starting notes of the melody. Whether you're a musician looking for inspiration or simply curious about AI-generated music, this project has something for everyone.

## Project Overview

- **AI Model**: We have integrated the Google Magenta RNN model for music generation, enabling the generation of melodies that can be both innovative and harmonious.

- **User Interface**: Our user-friendly web-based UI provides an intuitive way for users to interact with the project. You can control the starting notes, adjust parameters, and listen to the generated music in real-time.

- **Backend**: The backend of our project handles the communication between the UI and the AI model. It processes user input, sends requests to the AI model, and plays the generated melodies back to the user.
